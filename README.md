##  Week-by-Week Learning Summary

###  Week 1: Kaggle 5-Day Generative AI Learning Path
- Learned the basics of GenAI and large language models (LLMs)
- Explored prompt engineering, transformers, hallucinations, and ethical use
- Gained beginner-friendly insights through hands-on exercises

###  Week 2: DeepLearning.AI Short Courses
1. **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers**  
   Learned how to write zero-shot, few-shot, and structured prompts.
2. **Building Systems with ChatGPT**  
   Explored multi-step LLM pipelines and system evaluation techniques.
3. **LangChain for LLM Application Development**  
   Built end-to-end LLM apps using chains, memory, agents, and tool usage.

##  Prompts Included

The `prompt_examples.md` file contains:
- Role-based prompt design
- Few-shot prompting with input/output formatting
- Task classification and reasoning prompts

These represent some of the most effective techniques I practiced during the short courses.

##  Git & GitHub Practice

As part of this assignment:
- I created and cloned this repository using GitHub
- I tracked files using `git add` and committed changes with `git commit`
- I made **2+ commits** and pushed everything to the cloud using `git push`

This helped reinforce my understanding of version control and collaboration workflows.
