WEEK 1: INTRODUCTION TO GENERATIVE AI  
(Source: Kaggle’s 5-Day Learning Path)

In Week 1, I began my Generative AI journey by completing Kaggle’s structured 5-day learning guide.  
This course introduced me to the fundamentals of Generative AI and how large language models (LLMs) are designed and used in real-world applications.

KEY LEARNINGS FROM WEEK 1:
- Generative AI models like ChatGPT can generate text, code, summaries, and more.
- These models work using the transformer architecture with tokens and attention mechanisms.
- Explored various real-world use cases such as summarization, question answering, and classification.
- Understood the importance of prompt engineering — how phrasing a prompt clearly affects the output.
- Learned about risks such as hallucination (models making up facts).
- Discovered the concept of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), which is used to fine-tune model behavior.

Week 1 gave me a solid theoretical foundation in LLMs and helped me see their role across industries.

WEEK 2: PRACTICAL PROMPTING AND LLM SYSTEM DESIGN  
(Source: DeepLearning.AI Short Courses)

In Week 2, I focused on building real-world prompting skills and learned how to build complete LLM-powered systems. I completed three industry-standard short courses:

1. CHATGPT PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR DEVELOPERS:
- Learned how to write effective prompts using best practices.
- Practiced zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques.
- Understood how to guide model behavior using role-based prompting.
- Learned methods to reduce hallucinations and ensure reliable, structured outputs.
- Practiced formatting prompts for summarization, Q&A, classification, etc.

2. BUILDING SYSTEMS WITH CHATGPT:
- Learned how to structure multi-step AI workflows using sequences of prompts.
- Designed systems where one prompt’s output becomes the input for another.
- Understood how to evaluate model performance using helpfulness, accuracy, and safety.
- Practiced techniques to break down large tasks into manageable LLM components.
- Learned the importance of prompt testing and iteration.

3. LANGCHAIN FOR LLM APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT:
- Learned what LangChain is and how it helps in building AI applications.
- Understood the concept of Chains (sequential logic) and Agents (decision-making models).
- Explored how to add tools like calculators, search APIs, and memory to LLMs.
- Learned how LangChain manages context using memory modules (like conversational chatbots).
- Explored the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for chaining components together.

------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION:

By the end of Week 2, I had moved from beginner-level theory to building practical systems using LLMs.  
I can now:
- Design prompts for different tasks with role-based and few-shot techniques.
- Structure and evaluate LLM workflows with multiple steps.
- Build smart, dynamic applications using LangChain and tools.
- Avoid common pitfalls like hallucinations and prompt instability.

This learning has built a strong foundation for my future projects in Generative AI and real-world application development.
