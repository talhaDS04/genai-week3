GenAI Learning Journey – 2-Week Summary  
This document outlines my two-week learning journey into Generative AI (GenAI), covering a structured 5-day course from Kaggle and three short courses from DeepLearning.ai. These learnings introduced me to prompt engineering, building LLM systems, and applying LangChain for GenAI applications.

 WEEK 1: KAGGLE’S 5-DAY GENERATIVE AI LEARNING PATH  
 Overview  
Completed a 5-day beginner-friendly GenAI course hosted on Kaggle. The course focused on foundational concepts, large language models (LLMs), and real-world use cases such as summarization, generation, and question answering.

 Daily Breakdown  
Day 1 – Introduction to Generative AI  
- What is Generative AI and how it differs from traditional AI  
- Common GenAI applications in text, code, image, and video generation  

Day 2 – Prompt Engineering  
- Learned how to write effective prompts for large language models  
- Practiced changing prompts to influence model output style and accuracy  

Day 3 – Text Generation Tasks  
- Experimented with writing, summarization, classification, and question answering  
- Used sample models to test GenAI capabilities interactively  

Day 4 – Evaluating AI Outputs  
- Learned about hallucinations and factual errors in LLMs  
- Explored how human feedback helps fine-tune model outputs  

Day 5 – Applying GenAI Responsibly  
- Ethical concerns in AI-generated content  
- Bias, misinformation, and the need for human oversight  

 Key Concepts Mastered  
- Transformer-based LLMs  
- Zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting  
- Prompt engineering best practices  
- AI output evaluation and safety  
- Real-world GenAI use cases  

 Insight  
Week 1 provided a solid foundation on how GenAI works and why prompt design is critical. I also developed a beginner’s understanding of how LLMs interpret user intent and generate outputs accordingly.

 WEEK 2: DEEPLEARNING.AI SHORT COURSES – PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS  

 Courses Completed  
1. ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers  
- Learned prompt patterns: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought  
- Practiced writing structured prompts with clear instructions  
- Used role-based prompts to simulate expert behavior  
- Reduced hallucinations by formatting prompts for better reliability  

2. Building Systems with ChatGPT  
- Learned to design multi-step GenAI systems using modular prompts  
- Built pipelines that classify, transform, and structure data using LLMs  
- Evaluated LLM performance using helpfulness, accuracy, and safety  
- Practiced refining prompt chains and outputs through iteration  

3. LangChain for LLM Application Development  
- Introduced to LangChain’s architecture for GenAI apps  
- Built basic chains and agents that use memory and tools  
- Learned to integrate LLMs with search tools, calculators, and external APIs  
- Understood LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to structure logic  

Tools & Technologies Used  
- OpenAI API (for prompt testing)  
- LangChain Python library  
- JSON-based output formatting  
- Conversational memory and tool calling  

 Key Takeaways  
- Prompt design is both an art and a science—good structure = better output  
- LLM systems require evaluation, debugging, and safety checks  
- LangChain is essential for building scalable, real-world LLM applications  
- Agents can dynamically decide which actions to take using reasoning  

------------------------------------------------------------

 FINAL Seek  
Through this two-week journey, I moved from understanding GenAI fundamentals to building real applications using prompt chaining, memory, and agentic workflows. I now feel confident in:

- Writing powerful prompts to achieve specific tasks  
- Designing reliable and safe LLM-powered systems  
- Using LangChain and OpenAI tools to build real-world GenAI applications  

This foundation prepares me to apply GenAI in domains like education, productivity tools, and more advanced pipelines that require external knowledge, context retention, and intelligent tool use.
